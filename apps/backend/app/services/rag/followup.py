"""Questions that cannot be searched for on their own.

"How can we reduce it?" is a perfectly clear question to a student who just
asked about friction, and meaningless to an embedding model. The topic is not
in the sentence -- it is in the previous turn -- so the vector lands wherever
the leftover words point. In exp004 on the target (Class 6 Science, 11 Sep)
that question retrieved soil erosion (p.17) and the balanced-diet pyramid
(p.64) at 0.33-0.36, inside the 0.42 gate, and the tutor answered from them.
Six of the ten pronoun follow-ups in that run left their chapter the same way.
The distances look healthy because a question with no content is a mediocre
match for everything, so no threshold can catch it.

The fix is to put the topic back before embedding, by carrying the previous
question along: "What is frictional force? How can we reduce it?" retrieves
the friction section at 0.21. Replayed against the shipped index, carrying put
the answer passage first for seven of those ten follow-ups, against four.

Carrying it on EVERY turn is not the fix, and measuring that is what shaped
this module (on the multilingual branch, commit a47bee3). "What is
photosynthesis?" asked after a chemistry question retrieves nothing at all on
its own -- correctly, the corpus does not cover it, and the tutor says so.
Carried, it retrieved ATOMIC NUMBER, cleared the gate, and answered a botany
question out of the chemistry chapter. Always-on trades one silent failure for
another.

So it is conditional, and the condition is the thing that actually causes the
problem: a reference pointing outside the sentence. A question that changes
topic does not contain one -- nobody writes "what is photosynthesis?" with a
dangling "it" -- which is exactly why this test separates the two cases when a
distance threshold cannot.
